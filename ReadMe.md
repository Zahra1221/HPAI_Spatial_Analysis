# HPAI in Canada: Discovering Hot and Cold Spots and Environmental Drivers

This repository provides dataset for spatial analysis of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in Canada. 
HPAI outbreaks have increased worldwide in recent years, creating significant challenges for animal health, food security, and the poultry sector. Understanding the spatial distribution of outbreaks and the environmental factors that influence them is essential for effective monitoring and control. This study contributes to that objective by conducting a detailed spatial assessment of HPAI occurrences across Canada, pinpointing regions at elevated risk and identifying the primary environmental and agricultural determinants linked to disease emergence. The results provide actionable knowledge to strengthen targeted surveillance, improve biosecurity measures, and inform science-based policy and management decisions within a One Health context.
